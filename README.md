# Provider GitHub

`provider-github` is a [Crossplane](https://crossplane.io/) provider that
is built using [Upjet](https://github.com/upbound/upjet) code
generation tools and exposes XRM-conformant managed resources for the
GitHub API.

This provider is built mainly based on the document [here](https://github.com/upbound/upjet/blob/main/docs/generating-a-provider.md).
